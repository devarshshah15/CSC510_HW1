Repository for first homework of CSC 510


## What is .gitignore?

The purpose of .gitignore  file is to ensure that certain files are not tracked by the git.

## What is Code of Conduct?

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community.

## What is _init_.py?

The _init_.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.

## What is CONTRIBUTING.md?

This file provides information on how a potential contributor can get started to contribute to this repository. More importantly, it outlines the guidelines that they should follow while making changes to the repository from creating an issue to sending a pull request so as to maintain the standards of the repository.

## LICENSE.MD

We have selected the MIT License as it is a simple and short permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Since it is permissive, you have access to a lot of permissions and few restrictions. You can modify, distribute, and use code for private and commercial purposes.

## Requirements.txt

Requirement.txt is a file containing a list of packages that need to be installed using pip install for the project. The package names are also mentioned with the version if the project requires a specific version to be installed. This allows other developers to easily install all the python packages required to run our source code.

## what is Zenodo DOI?

Zenodo is a platform to make the work easier to cite and supports various data and license types. Here you can permanently archive your code and other project elements. Zenodo does this by assigning projects a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which also helps to make the work more citable.

## what is setup.py?

setup.py tells what module/package you are about to install. It allows you to easily install Python package.

## Why use .travis.yml?

This file specifies the programming language used, the desired building and testing environment (including dependencies which must be installed before the software can be built and tested), and various other parameters. As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.
